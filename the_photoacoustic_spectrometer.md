## Retrieving Integrated Area
The term "integrated area" in the case of this system is a misnomer.  It is derived from a former data acquisition system that actually retrieved an integrated area from the frequency domain signal of the microphone with the speaker off.  In the case of the current system, the "Integrated Area" is simply the value at a single point.
