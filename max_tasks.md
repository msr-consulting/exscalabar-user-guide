# MAX Tasks
Most analog and digital communication is performed directly through DAQmx, the native DAQ driver for communication with National Instruments devices.  All communication with NI devices is configured through Tasks in MAX.  To view available tasks or to create new ones, the user must

* navigate to the remote system (**exscalabar**)
* select *Data Neighborhood* to expand this folder 
* select *NI-DAQmx Tasks* to view the currently configured tasks

The user may directly interact with the hardware via the preconfigured tasks by selecting double-clicking on the task and clicking the run button (see below).
