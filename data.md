# Data
Data retrieved from the various entities are registered at startup as *emmiters* with a data value reference (DVR) that is maintained as a property of the ``Controller`` object called ``MAP DVR``.  When data is broadcast by the various emmitters, then the DVR will capture these broadcasts and make them accessible to the various processes that require them.
