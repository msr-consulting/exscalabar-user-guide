## Using Git
The version control system used at the time or writing is git.  The repository is maintained on [Github](http://github.com).  Currently, there are two separate repositories for the project:

* [exscalabar](http://github.com/lo-co/exscalabar) - this repository is used for storing user interface code.
* [exscalabar_server](http://github.com/lo-co/exscalabar)
