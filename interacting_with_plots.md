# Interacting with Plots
Plots on the user interface are based on the canvas plotter [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com).  As such, the plots utilize many of the same interactive means that dygraphs API defines.  
## Zooming
Zooming in on points is accomplished via left mouse button.  To zoom in on y-values (i.e. to decrease the y-range), simply left click and drag straight down.  To zoom in on particular x-values, left click on the plot and drag right or left.  To return the view to the original setup (i.e. autoscaled to the current view maximum and minimum), double click using the left mouse.
