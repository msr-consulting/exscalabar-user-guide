# The Main Data File
The main data file contains all of the data collected at 1 Hz by the server.  This includes CRD values such as taus and PAS integrated area as well as data from devices and general system state.  The location of the main data file is found on an auxilary drive connected to the PXI chassis via a USB port.  Drives are labeled in order and start at ``u:``.
