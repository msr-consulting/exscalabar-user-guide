# System Messages
System messages are generated by the server and returned in the data stream from the server under the entry ``Msg``.  This entry contains an array of strings representing these messages.  The system messages may be viewed by clicking the mail icon on the right hand side of the navigation bar.  System messages are usually green but may appear red in the case of an error.

Messages may arrive from a variety of places on the server.  Each message string is preceded by a time stamp and then the location where the message was generated followed by the message itself.  Aside from the color, error messages are also indicated by the bracketed word ERROR.
