# Files
The server will write several different files depending on configuration settings and user input.  These are:

* the main file - this is the primary source of data and may be mirrored to two drives depending on the initial user settings.
* CRD tau data - this is a record of all taus calculated by the system.
* PAS frequency data - this is frequency data related to the PAS operation.
