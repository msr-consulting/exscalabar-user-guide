# Configuration
The server is configured via an INI file located on the server under the folder ``c:\exscalabar\cfg`` called ``exscalabar.ini``.  The file is written in the standard [INI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file); that is, a file broken out into sections (denoted by square braces) containing a series of key-value pairs.
